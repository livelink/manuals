h1. LiveLink Manuals

A Rails 3.1 based knowledge base website, for maintaining manuals and FAQs 
in a sane format online.  It will rely on an OAuth2 provider, such as google for secure authentication without password/account proliferation.

Basic styling is based on "Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com by Zurb.
