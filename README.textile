h1. LiveLink Manuals

A Rails 3.1 based knowledge base website, for maintaining manuals and FAQs in a sane format online.  It will rely on an OAuth2 provider, such as google for secure authentication without password/account proliferation.

It uses "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile/ for documentation and allows inline diagrams using "ditaa":http://ditaa.sourceforge.net.

Basic styling is based on "Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com by "Zurb":http://zurb.com.

Status:
* Supports manuals, which consist of chapters
* Initial login/logout via Google's OpenID service

Todo:
* Authentication lockdown (basic auth working, but no permission checks)
* Papertrail integration for monitoring edit history
* Paperclip integration for images & downloads associated with manuals
* FAQ support

h2. Uses:

* Rails 3.1 (+jQuery,SASS,CoffeeScript)
* Omniauth (for OpenID authentication)
* Gravatar (for user profile pics)
* ACE Editor (for textile editing)
* SyntaxHighlighter (for display code highlighting)
* Foundation (for CSS)
* FamFamFam Silk Icons
